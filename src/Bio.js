            <h1>Hi, I'm Bodie!</h1>
            <p>A software engineer and game developer with over 5 years of experience!
                I graduated from UT Dallas with a Bachleor's in Computer Science in 2019, but my learning hasn't stopped. I continuously learn new languages and technologies every day, and I always seek new challenges with every project I work on.
                Coding is my passion, and my goal is to use code to bring fun and engaging experiences to everyone!
